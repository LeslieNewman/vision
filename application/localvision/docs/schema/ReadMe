The methods in the file "/localvision/docs/schema/xref.sample" can be
used to generate a cross reference guide to your installation's
classes and messages (Section 3 of the Vision manual).  The sample
script "doc.S" can be used as standard input to batchvision to
generate an up-to-date message cross reference of your Vision
database.  Load and execute this code as is, or modify it to
accommodate your specific formatting requirements.  To run use:  

     batchvision < doc.S >& tmp &

When this job completes, the file "classes.doc" will contain all
messages by class, sorted alphabetically within class type and the
file "xref.doc" will contain a cross reference of all messages
defined for any class in the database.
