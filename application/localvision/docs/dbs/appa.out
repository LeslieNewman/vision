                                 Driver Installation Summary




            1.  Create New Update Directory

            Each database driver is stored  in  its  own  Unix  directory  in  the
            /localvision/update directory tree.  Use the following steps to create
            a new update directory for the data source Demo:

               cd /localvision/update
               /localvision/tools/NewDB Demo

            You will be asked if  this  is  a  LocalEntity-style  reconcile.   The
            update  directory  Demo  will  then  be  created  with the appropriate
            starter files and subdirectories.


            2.  Create Layout Files

            Each data set associated with the data source requires its own  layout
            file.   For  example, if there are three data sets named demoA, demoB,
            and demoC, you  would  create  the  files  demoA.lay,  demoB.lay,  and
            demoC.lay  in  the the /localvision/update/Demo/layouts directory.  If
            this is a LocalEntity-style update, there is typically  one  data  set
            that  is  updated  on  a  regular  basis.   This file is usually named
            "snapshot" and the layout file named "snapshot.lay" should  be  placed
            in the layouts directory.


            3.  Create the "Build" Script

            All structures and fields defined in the layout file  must  correspond
            to  classes and properties defined in Vision.  A separate object space
            is created to store these classes and any methods  needed  to  support
            reconciling  this  database.   For  this  purpose, a "build" script is
            created and saved in the data source's object space.  This  file  must
            be executed and saved prior to the first update for the data source.

            To convert your layout files into a  Vision  "build"  script,  do  the
            following:

                 cd /localvision/update/Demo
                 /localvision/tools/createBLD >& scripts/BLDDemo

            After you create this script you should review it for errors  in  your
            layouts and make any corrections.  Then re-generate the script.


            4.  Install the "Build" Script

            To test the "Build" script, start up a Vision session and read in  the
            file  you  created.   You should see a message that a new object space
            has been created.   You  should  not  see  any  "Selector  Not  Found"
            messages or any other errors.

            To install this script execute the following in Unix:

                 cd /localvision/update/Demo
                 /localvision/transactions/scripts/installSpace DB

            You will be prompted for the name of a build  file.   Enter  the  file
            name  (scripts/BLDDemo) followed by a carriage return.  The new object
            space will be created and the new classes and methods will be saved in
            it.


            5.  Loading the Data

            Data can be supplied  by  external  vendors  in  a  variety  of  forms
            including tape, transmission, and pc disk.  Usually, this data is read
            and  stored  in  a  temporary  working  directory  separate  from  the
            /localvision  directories.   The  working  directory  should  have two
            subdirectories, a Data directory that contains  raw  data  files  with
            date  extensions  and  a  Token  directory  that  contains  files that
            indicate that data is ready.  The contents of a token file is the date
            extension  to  be  used  to  locate  the  appropriate file in the Data
            directory.

            For example, assume your working directory is named /rawdata  and  the
            demo  data file from April 1994 is available for processing.  Then the
            following files would exist:

                 /rawdata/Data/demo.9404               contains actual data
                 /rawdata/Token/demo                   contains string 9404

            To Load this data into your Demo processing  directory  use  the  Load
            script with the name of the raw data directory as a parameter:

                 cd /localvision/update/Demo
                 Load /rawdata

            The data will be loaded into the data directory  and  the  appropriate
            processing tokens will be set.

            6.  Processing the Data

            Once the data has been loaded, the Go script is used  to  convert  the
            raw data stored in the data directory into Vision objects.

            To execute the Go script for the Demo data you loaded, run:

                 cd /localvision/update/Demo
                 Go >& logs/log.demo.9404 &

            The final step of the  Go  process  is  to  reconcile  the  data  with
            existing Vision objects.  The Reconcile process will not run until you
            have added the appropriate reconcile rules.


            7.  Adding the Reconcile Rules

            A starter reconciliation script is supplied in the scripts  directory.
            Once  you have made any modifications, start Vision with the -U option
            specifying the correct object space.  For example,  if  Demo  data  is
            stored in object space 14, start Vision using:

                 vision -U14

            Read in the reconcile script and execute it.  Then execute:

                 updateDate evaluate: [ DataSource reconcile ] ;

            When the reconcile script has been tested, you can save it  using  the
            "dbSubmit" utility in Unix:

                 dbSubmit scripts/RECDemo

            You will be prompted for an object space number.  If the update daemon
            has not been started for your system, execute:

                 cd /localvision/transactions/scripts
                 processUpdate



            8.  Running the Reconcile

            Once the reconcile script has been saved, you can  run  the  reconcile
            for the data that has already been incorporated by executing:

                 cd /localvision/update/Demo
                 helpers/Reconcile >& logs/rec.demo.9404 &

            Future updates will automatically run this reconcile step as  part  of
            the Go process.
